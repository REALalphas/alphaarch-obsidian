# Partitioning
1. Easy way
	1. Boot into another OS with GUI from USB stick
	2. Make partitions with gparted or gnome-disks
	3. Reboot into archiso

1. HARD way
	1. Think yourself

2. You will need 2 partitions or 3 in case with swap. 
	- **You don't have to format now as we'll do it later, just make partitions now**
	- / [root] *Btrfs (recomended), Ext4 and other* (Most of your disk space)
	- /boot [EFI (esp)] *Fat32* 1 GiB
	- swap [swap] *Linux swap file system* **optional** 8-32 GiB (as you want)

3. Boot into archiso
4. To define your disk and partitions use `fdisk -l` (Every useful command you can find in [[Useful commands]])
5. Now we need to format our partitions to needed type
	1. For [root] run `mkfs.btrfs /dev/<root partition>` (`mkfs.btrfs` can changed to `mkfs.ext4` etc.)
	2. For [EFI (esp)] run `mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/<efi partition>`
	3. For [swap] if you created partition for it) run

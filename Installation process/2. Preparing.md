# Partitioning
1. Easy way
	1. Boot into another OS with GUI from USB stick
	2. Make partitions with gparted or gnome-disks
	3. Reboot into archiso

1. HARD way
	1. Think yourself

2. You will need 2 partitions or 3 in case with swap. 
	- **You don't have to format now as we'll do it later, just make partitions now**
	- `/` [root]
	File system: Btrfs (recomended), Ext4 and other
	Size: Most of your disk space
	- `/boot` [EFI (esp)]
	File system: Fat32
	Size: 1 GiB
	- `swap` [swap] **optional**
	File system: Linux swap file system
	Size: 8-32 GiB (as you want)

3. Boot into archiso
4. To define your disk and partitions use `fdisk -l` (Every useful command you can find in [[Useful commands]])
5. Now we need to format our partitions to needed type
	1. For [root] run
	`mkfs.<filesystem type> /dev/<root partition>`
	replace "filesystem type" with "btrfs" (recomended) or "ext4" or other
	2. For [EFI (esp)] run
	`mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/<efi partition>`
	3. For [swap] (if you created partition for it) run
	`mkswap /dev/<swap partition>`

# Mounting and installation of initially important programs
1. We need to mount our partitions to `/mnt`

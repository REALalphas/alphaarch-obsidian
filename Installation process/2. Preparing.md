# Partitioning
1. Easy way
	1. Boot into another OS with GUI from USB stick
	2. Make partitions with gparted or gnome-disks
	3. Reboot into archiso

1. HARD way
	1. Think yourself

You will need 2 partitions or 3 in case with swap. 
**You don't have to format now as we'll do it later, just make partitions now**
- `/` root
File system: Btrfs (recomended) or Ext4 or other
Size: Most of your disk space
- `/boot` EFI (esp)
File system: Fat32
Size: 1 GiB
- `swap` swap **optional**
File system: Linux swap file system
Size: 8-32 GiB (as you want)

### Formatting partitions
1. Boot into archiso (If you hear scarry beeps run `setterm -blength 0`)
2. To define your disk and partitions use `fdisk -l` (Every useful command you can find in [[Useful commands]])
3. Now we need to format our partitions to needed type
	1. For root run
	```
	mkfs.<filesystem type> /dev/<root partition>
	```
	*replace "filesystem type" with "btrfs" (recomended) or "ext4" or other*
	
	2. For EFI (esp) run
	```
	mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/<efi partition>
	```
	1. For swap (if you created partition for it) run
	```
	mkswap /dev/<swap partition>
	```

/dev/*** it can be nvme0n* or sd*
# Mounting and installation of initially important programs
1. We need to mount our partitions to `/mnt`
	1. Mount root
	```
	mount /dev/<root partition> /mnt
	```
	2. Mount EFI
	```
	mount /dev/<efi partition> /mnt/boot
	```
	*if you see error like "no directory /mnt/boot" run `mkdir /mnt/boot`*
	
	3. Mount swap if you have it
	```
	swapon /dev/<swap partition>
	```
	4. Install base packages
	```
	pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware
	```
	5. Install file systems packages
	```
	pacstrap /mnt btrfs-progs dosfstools e2fsprogs ntfs-3g
	```
	*You can install other file systems. See in [File systems](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/File_systems)*

	6. *If you use RAID or LVM see [RAID](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/RAID) and [LVM](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/LVM). if not just ignore.*
	7. Look for your devices and install firmware if needed.
	linux-firmware may already do all of your job. = /
	
	8. Install network packages
	```
	pacstrap /mnt iproute2 dhcpcd iwd
	```
